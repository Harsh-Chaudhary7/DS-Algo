# Tree-DS

This Repo consists of questions related to Tree Data Structure.

## What is a tree?

```
Tree is a non-linear data structure used for file management,hierarchy respresentation,comments & replies etc.

Each entry of the tree is called as node.
The topmost node of the tree is called as root node.
Bottom-most nodes are called as leaf nodes.

Height of the tree is equal to the links to farthest node.
Depth of the tree is equal to Height of tree.

Depth of node is equal to the number of links from root node to that node.

## Traversals of Tree

  **BFS**
  
  ```
  
  BFS is the abbrevation of Breadth First Search.
  In BFS the nearest nodes are traversed first.
  This is an example of how BFS traversal is done.
  
  ```

  **DFS**
  
  ```
  
  DFS stands for Depth First Search.
  It is same as it sounds traversal is done till the bottom most node i.e. leaf node.
  Example:-
  
  ```

  </p>


**Note:- BFS will find the shortest path to any node.**

  **Pre-Order Traversal**
  
  ```
  
    Preorder (Root, Left, Right).  
    First the Root node is travesed then the left node and after that the right node.
    Example:-
    
  ```

  </p>
  
  **In-Order Traversal**
 
  ```
  
   Inorder (Left, Root, Right)
   First the left node is traversed then the root node and then the right node.
   Example:-
   
  ```

  </p>
  
  **Post-Order Traversal**
  
  ```
   
   Postorder (Right, Left, Root)
   First the right node is traversed then the left node and at last the root node is traversed.
   Example:-
   
  ```
